# Counter.js

A _simple_ number counter in JavaScript as a jQuery plugin.
It counts to or down to the number set on an element using an easing effect.

You can configure certain options such as a duration, easing effect, auto start,
start at count, placeholder (for use with auto start) and it supports callbacks.

## Example

The index.html file contains a working example of the counter.

It's also live at
[tombruijn.github.io/counter.js](http://tombruijn.github.io/counter.js).

## Usage

__Simplest implementation:__

```html
<!-- HTML -->
<div id="counter">1024</div>
```

```javascript
// JavaScript
$("#counter").counter();
```

__With some more options:__

```javascript
// JavaScript
$("#counter").counter({
  autoStart: false,         // true/false, default: true
  duration: 5000,           // milliseconds, default: 1500
  countFrom: 10,            // start counting at this number, default: 0
  countTo: 30,              // count to this number, default: 0
  placeholder: "?",         // replace the number with this before counting,
                            // most useful with autoStart: false. default: undefined
  easing: "easeOutCubic",   // see http://gsgd.co.uk/sandbox/jquery/easing
                            // for all available effects, see visual examples:
                            // http://easings.net
                            // default: "easeOutQuad"
  onStart: function() {},   // callback on start of the counting
  onComplete: function() {} // callback on completion of the counting
});
```

Counter.js supports counting up and counting down.
If either countFrom or countTo is not set it will try to determine which value
you meant by its set value on the element and the countFrom and countTo options.
You can also not set a value on the element and use both options.

## Installation

If you're just interested in just using the script then copy the
`js/counter.min.js` file in your project.
Then add the libraries as described in `Requirements` below.

## Requirements

You will need two libraries, jQuery (works with v2 and up, v1.64 and up
(I use as little jQuery as possible)) and the jQuery easing plugin (v1.3).

Make sure to add these files to your project in this order:

```javascript
jquery.js        // Download from: http://jquery.com
jquery.easing.js // Download from: http://gsgd.co.uk/sandbox/jquery/easing/
counter.js       // Is located in this repository under `js/counter.js`
                 // A minified version is also available.
```

_(I don't recommend you using the `js/jquery.js` and `js/jquery.easing.js` files
that are available in this repository in your project.
Instead download the latest ones from [jquery.com](http://jquery.com/) and
[gsgd.co.uk (jQuery.easing)](http://gsgd.co.uk/sandbox/jquery/easing/).)_

## Contributing

Want to help make this better? Or just modify it?
Fork the project and send in a Pull Request.

Do you need help to start the development? Here's how:

### Requirements

For development you will need a CoffeeScript compiler and JavaScript minifier.
I use the one in [Node.js](http://nodejs.org).
For minification I use [UglifyJS2](https://github.com/mishoo/UglifyJS2).

### Compilation

Once you modified the CoffeeScript you will need to compile it to JavaScript
if you want to run it (do not commit it!).
There's a `Makefile` available in the repo to do so.

_You do not need to commit the compiled JavaScript or minify it, that will be
done with every new release._

If you like entering commands in the terminal more, use one of these commands:

__One time compilation and minification:__

_See the commands in the bundled Makefile._

__Compilation on save:__

`coffee --watch --compile ./js/counter.coffee`

### Testing

This project is tested with [Jasmine](http://pivotal.github.io/jasmine/).

In the spec directory you can find all the tests for this project.
It uses the Jasmine Ruby gem so I doesn't have to copy Jasmine into this
project.

Start the Jasmine server with `rake jasmine`.
